A sample analysis of hypothetical season ticket holders for an NFL franchise. The goal was to predict which season ticket holders would be most likely to renew, given data on ticket renewal from previous year. I conducted the exploratory data analysis in R studio and then performed the modeling (random forest model) in Python. Finally I crated a PowerPoint presentation to simulate presenting my findings to non techincal leadership within the NFL front office.
