A sample analysis of hypothetical season ticket holders for an NFL franchise. The goal was to predict which season ticket holders would be most likely to renew, given data on ticket renewal from the previous year. I conducted the exploratory data analysis in R studio and then performed the modeling (random forest model) in Python. Finally, I created a PowerPoint slide deck to present my findings to non technical leadership within an NFL front office.
